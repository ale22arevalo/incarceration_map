# incarceration_map
This project visualizes the incarcerated population across the U.S. I made the made using R and then made an infographic in Figma which also shows top 3 counties with highest incarcerated share of their population.
The data was obtained via The Marshall Project and corresponds to the 2020 U.S. Census.
